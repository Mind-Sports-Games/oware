Description: Oware Abapa game engine
 Aalina is a strong oware abapa playing program. It communicates with a
 Graphical User Interface through an adapted version of the Universal Chess
 Interface protocol. This mancala engine is thus usually invoked by a GUI such
 as Aual√©, which is the official interface for this engine.
 .
 Its features include:
 .
  * Plays mancala following the popular Abapa ruleset.
  * Includes an extensive opening book.
  * May use endgame databases to improve its strength.
  * Completely configurable through the UCI protocol.
