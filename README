  What is it?
  -----------

  Aalina - Oware Abapa game engine

  Aalina is a strong oware abapa playing program. It communicates with
  a Graphical User Interface through an adapted version of the
  Universal Chess Interface protocol. This mancala engine is thus
  usually invoked by a GUI such as Aual√© [1], which is the official
  interface for this engine but can also be played on the terminal.

  Its features include:

   * Command line interface.
   * Plays mancala following the popular Abapa ruleset.
   * Completely configurable through the UCI protocol.
   * Includes a set of engine optimization tools.

  Implementation details:

   * Negamax search.
   * Iterative deepening.
   * Principal variation search.
   * Optimized evaluation heuristics.
   * Minimal perfect hashing of positions.
   * Endgame tablebases (12 seeds or less).
   * Openings book (about 200.000 positions).
   * Two-tier transposition table with aging.
