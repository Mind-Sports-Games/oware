  What is it?
  -----------

  Aalina - Oware Abapa game engine

  Aalina is a strong oware abapa playing program. It communicates with
  a Graphical User Interface through an adapted version of the
  Universal Chess Interface protocol. This mancala engine is thus
  usually invoked by a GUI such as Aual√©, which is the official
  interface for this engine.

  Its features include:

   * Plays mancala following the popular Abapa ruleset.
   * Includes an extensive opening book.
   * May use endgame databases to improve its strength.
   * Completely configurable through the UCI protocol.
